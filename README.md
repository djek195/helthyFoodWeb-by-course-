This project is a healthy eating website that includes various functional features for the user.
JS was the main programming language used to create various functions on the page, such as working 
with elements on the page, creating modal windows, a countdown timer for promotions, a calorie calculator,
classes, promises, and working with the server using JSON and the Fetch API.

In addition, other technologies such as Webpack and Babel were used in the project to support development 
standards and ensure compatibility with browsers.

All of these functional features were integrated into a convenient and simple interface for the healthy eating website,
so that users could easily and conveniently interact with them.
